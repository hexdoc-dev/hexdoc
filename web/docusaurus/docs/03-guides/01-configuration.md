# Config File

Most configuration for hexdoc can be done in the `hexdoc.toml` (or `doc/hexdoc.toml`) file.

## JSON Schema

If you use a TOML validator with JSON Schema support (eg. the [Even Better TOML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tamasfe.even-better-toml) VSCode extension), you can get autocomplete and validation for `hexdoc.toml` files by using the [autogenerated JSON Schema definition](https://hexdoc.hexxy.media/schema/core/Properties.json).

With Taplo-based tools like Even Better TOML, you can enable the schema by adding the following comment to the top of `hexdoc.toml` ([docs](https://taplo.tamasfe.dev/configuration/directives.html#the-schema-directive)):

```toml
#:schema https://hexdoc.hexxy.media/schema/core/Properties.json
```

## API Docs

The `hexdoc.toml` file models are included in hexdoc's auto-generated API documentation.

All relevant classes can be found in the following module: [hexdoc.core.properties](static:///docs/api/hexdoc/core/properties.html)
