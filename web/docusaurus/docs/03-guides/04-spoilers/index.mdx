# Spoilers

Patchouli's [advancement locking system](https://vazkiimods.github.io/Patchouli/docs/patchouli-basics/advancement-locking) can be used with hexdoc to automatically add a spoiler blur to late-game categories, entries, and (as of `v1!0.1.0a11`) pages.

## Marking advancements as spoilers

hexdoc checks a [custom tag](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tag) in the `advancements` registry (`#hexdoc:spoilered`) to figure out which advancements are considered spoilers. This tag is empty by default.

To mark an advancement as spoilered, add it to a JSON tag file in the correct location. This tag is not used ingame, so it will work fine if created in a hexdoc-only resources directory.

```json title="doc/resources/data/hexdoc/tags/advancements/spoilered.json"
{
  "replace": false,
  "values": ["minecraft:nether/all_effects"]
}
```

:::tip

Because [`fnmatch.fnmatch`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html#fnmatch.fnmatch) is used for comparisons, resource locations in this file can include wildcards (eg. `hexcasting:lore/*`).

As seen in this screenshot, Hex Casting's hexdoc plugin [adds several advancements](https://github.com/object-Object/HexMod/blob/3c7d0e88707a13a6e2c7d4cc75472a8763e6253c/doc/resources/data/hexdoc/tags/advancements/spoilered.json) to `#hexdoc:spoilered` which can be used by addons.
